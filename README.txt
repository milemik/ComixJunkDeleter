Hi there wellcome to README file.
This script is ment to delete the last image from cbr and cbz files.
In order to do that you need to put all your cbr, cbz files to the files directory and run the comics.py.

REQUIREMENTS:

##### In order for script to work you need to have python 3.6 or grater installed
you can do that:
	1) on windows download python from this link (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/python-3.7.3-amd64.exe for 64bit OS
						or https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/python-3.7.3.exe for 32bit OS)
		a) install python.exe file
			IMPORTANT: CHECK THE BOX FOR ADDING PYTHON TO THE PATH

	2) on linux python is already installed
	3) on mac : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hGzGdRQeak

### Next install nesessary modules by opening the terminal navigate to the req.txt file in folder Code (YOU CAN CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS FOLDER)
	and run this code:
		pip install -r req.txt
	This will install nesessary modules.

After this put your cbz, cbr files in files folder and run the script by doble click on comics.py file. But i strongly recommand to run the code from the terminal by navigating to file and run this command:
		on windows:
			python comics.py
		or on linux:
			python3 comics.py
		
		So you can see any error happend.

HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!
